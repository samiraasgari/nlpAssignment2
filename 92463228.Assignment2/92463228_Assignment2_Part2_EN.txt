experimental study of a wing in a propeller slipstream was made in order to determine the spanwise distribution of the lift increase due to slipstream at different angles of attack of the wing and at different free stream to slipstream velocity ratios 
the results were intended in part as an evaluation basis for different theoretical treatments of this problem 
the comparative span loading curves together with supporting evidence showed that a substantial part of the lift increment produced by the slipstream was due to a destalling or boundary layer control effect
